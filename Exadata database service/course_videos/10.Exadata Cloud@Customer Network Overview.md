**Part 1: Introduction and Lesson Objectives**

1.  This lesson covers provisioning an Exadata Cloud@Customer instance.
2.  After completing this lesson, you should be able to:
    *   Describe the provisioning and activation process for deploying the Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure.
    *   Create the VM cluster network used in a Cloud@Customer deployment.
    *   Provision the Exadata VM cluster on the Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure.
    *   Find and confirm the allocated VM cluster resources and networking details.

**Part 2: Network Architecture Overview (Cloud@Customer vs. Public Cloud)**

3.  The Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer provides the same user experience as the service on dedicated infrastructure in the public cloud.
4.  A key difference is that for Cloud@Customer, Oracle owns and manages the infrastructure, but it is physically located in **your data center**.

**Part 3: Client and Backup Networks**

5.  Client applications and administrators connect to VM clusters and databases over **private client and backup subnets** through a switch or router in your data center.
6.  Because the system is on your corporate network, connections **do not require** FastConnect, VPN, or an internet gateway, and bandwidth is guaranteed by your local network.
7.  The client and backup subnets are created within a component called the **VM cluster network**, not inside your OCI tenancy's Virtual Cloud Network (VCN).
8.  The Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure can support **multiple VM cluster networks**, but each VM cluster network can be associated with only **one VM cluster**.

**Part 4: The Control Plane Connection to OCI**

9.  The deployment includes a **control plane server infrastructure** that connects the Exadata Cloud@Customer system to an Oracle Cloud Infrastructure region for cloud automation and administration.
10. Your data center connects to this OCI region to access service endpoints like Object Storage, monitoring, identity service, and logging.

**Part 5: Key Networks in the Architecture**

11. **The Control Plane Network:**
    *   This is a VPN that connects the two control plane servers in the rack to OCI.
    *   It facilitates secure customer-initiated operations (via Console/APIs) and Oracle's monitoring and administration of the infrastructure.

12. **The Administration Network:**
    *   This network connects the Exadata servers and switches to the two control plane servers within the rack.
    *   It is used for management operations and monitoring.
    *   It is **fully contained within the Exadata rack** and does **not** connect directly to your corporate network.
    *   However, the Exadata infrastructure indirectly uses your corporate network (through the control plane servers) for DNS and NTP services.
    *   Therefore, the IP addresses used for the administration network **must be unique** and must not exist elsewhere in your corporate network.

**Part 6: DNS and Oracle Management Access**

13. You are required to register the hostnames and IP addresses for the Exadata Cloud@Customer **client and backup network** interfaces in your corporate DNS as part of the deployment.

14. The Oracle Cloud operations team manages the infrastructure using the OCI console or REST APIs over HTTPS or SSH.
15. Their HTTPS connections route through the Oracle service tenancy via the Admin VCN and then through a **persistent secure automation tunnel**.
