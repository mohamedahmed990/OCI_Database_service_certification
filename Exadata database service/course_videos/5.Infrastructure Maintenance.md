**Part 1: Overview of Infrastructure Maintenance**

1.  Oracle performs regularly scheduled updates to its cloud infrastructure to ensure performance, security, and to release new functionality.
2.  As part of this process, Oracle delivers Exadata quarterly bundle patches that include patches for both infrastructure maintenance and user-managed maintenance.

**Part 2: Quarterly Bundle Patches**

3.  The quarterly bundle patch includes **infrastructure patches** that:
    *   Apply security fixes.
    *   Solve critical issues.
    *   Execute proactive patching to keep the platform up-to-date and secure.

4.  These quarterly patches are applied in a **rolling fashion by default** to maintain service availability during the update process.

**Part 3: The Rolling Maintenance Process**

5.  **Database Server Maintenance:**
    *   Updates apply only to the database server hosts, not the customer VMs.
    *   Database servers are shut down, updated, and restarted one at a time.
    *   The other servers remain online.
    *   Database connections on the instance being updated are drained prior to shutdown.

6.  **Storage Server Maintenance:**
    *   This occurs after all database servers are updated.
    *   Storage servers are shut down, updated, and restarted one at a time.
    *   The other servers remain online.
    *   Storage server updates do not impact database server availability.

7.  ASM high redundancy (which creates three copies of data across different disks and storage servers) ensures data remains protected and highly available during storage maintenance.

8.  A **non-rolling maintenance option** is available but requires a full outage until all maintenance is complete. This option must be selected for the entire infrastructure, not just for database or storage servers individually.

**Part 4: Types of Infrastructure Updates**

9.  **Quarterly Updates** consist of one or more of the following:
    *   A new version of the Exadata system image.
    *   The latest security and essential patches for infrastructure components.
    *   Updates for the Cloud software components running on the infrastructure.

10. **Exadata Software Releases** introduce new Exadata features, support for new hardware, or both.

11. **Mandatory Time-Sensitive Updates** address unforeseen issues that cannot wait for the next quarterly cycle, such as:
    *   Critical security issues.
    *   Natural language support changes.
    *   Time zone data changes.
    *   Performance or availability issues.

**Part 5: Monthly Critical Security Updates**

12. Oracle releases monthly critical infrastructure software security updates.

13. For severe vulnerabilities (CVSS score greater than 7), Oracle will attempt to apply updates within 21 days of availability.

14. **In the Public Cloud:** Critical security updates are applied automatically online using Ksplice technology and cannot be deferred or rescheduled.

15. **On Cloud@Customer:** Monthly maintenance can be rescheduled to another date within a 21-day window that begins after the 15th of each month.

16. Critical storage server security updates are applied in a rolling manner and do not affect database availability.

17. If a monthly update *will* affect a database server's availability, Oracle will provide prior notification.

18. Oracle provides as much advanced notice as possible, normally a minimum of two weeks, for critical patches.

19. Notification will also be provided if security fixes include updates for the database server VM environment.

**Part 6: Maintenance Scheduling and Notification**

20. Infrastructure maintenance is mandatory, including both scheduled quarterly updates and potential emergency updates.

21. Customers are notified via configured event alerts and/or email to the configured infrastructure contacts.

22. If a customer has not specified a preference, a default schedule (at least two weeks after the update's availability) will be selected.

23. Customers can reschedule infrastructure maintenance to a date no more than 180 days from the last completed maintenance.

24. Monthly Security Patches can also be rescheduled but must be completed within their 21-day window.

25. Quarterly updates are released quarterly for commercial regions and monthly for government regions.

**Part 7: How to Set a Maintenance Window**

26. From the **Exadata Infrastructure Details** page, click the **Edit Maintenance Preference** action button to launch the **Configure Maintenance** screen.

27. At the top, select your preferred maintenance method: **Rolling** or **Non-Rolling**.

28. In the **Maintenance Schedule** section:
    *   Select **No Preference** to let Oracle schedule maintenance as needed.
    *   Select **Specify a Schedule** to restrict the timing.

29. If you choose **Specify a Schedule**, you can configure the following:
    *   **Maintenance Months:** Specify at least one month per quarter. Selecting multiple months per quarter is recommended if you require a long notification lead time.
    *   **Week of the Month:** Specify the week (weeks start on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd). Maintenance cannot be scheduled for a "fifth week."
    *   **Day of the Week:** Specify a day. If unspecified, Oracle will choose a weekend day.
    *   **Hour of the Day:** Specify the start hour. If unspecified, Oracle will choose a least disruptive time.
    *   **Notification Lead Time:** Specify the number of weeks' advance notice you require.

30. Click **Save Changes** to proceed.

**Part 8: Editing Scheduled Maintenance and Viewing History**

31. From the **Exadata Infrastructure Details** page, click the **View** link next to the quarterly maintenance to see upcoming task details (method, start time, estimated duration).

32. To change the date or time, select the **Edit Maintenance Run** button to reschedule the maintenance within compliance requirements.

33. To review past maintenance, click the **Maintenance History** tab on the left rail.
    *   This view shows what maintenance operations have been applied and how long each operation took.
