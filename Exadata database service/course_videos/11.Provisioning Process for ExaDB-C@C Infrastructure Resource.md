**Part 1: Overview of the Provisioning Process**

1.  Provisioning an Exadata Cloud@Customer system is a **collaborative process** between you and Oracle.
2.  The infrastructure provisioning follows this sequence:
    *   **Step 1:** You create the Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure resource in the OCI console.
    *   **Step 2:** You generate a file containing the infrastructure configuration details and provide it to Oracle.
    *   **Step 3:** Oracle physically installs the system in your data center and uses your configuration file for the initial setup.
    *   **Step 4:** Oracle supplies you with an **activation file**.
    *   **Step 5:** You activate the infrastructure by using the supplied activation file.
3.  Once activated, the infrastructure resource can be used to create **Exadata VM clusters** or **Autonomous VM clusters**.

**Part 2: The Control Plane Network**

4.  Each system contains two **control plane servers** that enable connectivity to an OCI region.
5.  The **Control Plane Network** is a VPN on your corporate network that connects these two servers to OCI.
6.  This VPN enables:
    *   Secure customer-initiated operations via the OCI Console and REST APIs.
    *   Secure monitoring and administration by Oracle.
7.  The control plane servers must be able to establish **outbound TCP port 443** access.
8.  You must provide the following for the control plane network:
    *   An IP address for each control plane server.
    *   The netmask and gateway IP.
    *   (If required) Your corporate HTTPS proxy details.

**Part 3: Internal System Networks (Not connected to your corporate network)**

9.  The system has two internal networks: the **Administration Network** and the **RoCE Network**.

10. **Administration Network:**
    *   **Purpose:** Enables Oracle to monitor and manage all system components (compute servers, storage servers, switches, PDUs).
    *   **Connectivity:** It connects the infrastructure components to the two control plane servers within the rack.
    *   **Isolation:** It is fully contained within the rack and does **not** connect directly to your corporate network.
    *   **Indirect Dependency:** The Exadata infrastructure indirectly uses your corporate network (through the control plane servers) for **DNS and NTP services**. Therefore, its IP addresses **must be unique** and must not exist elsewhere in your corporate network.
    *   **Server Interfaces:** Each database and storage server has two interfaces on this network: one for general management and one for the Integrated Lights Out Manager (ILOM).

11. **RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) Network:**
    *   **Purpose:** Replaces the older InfiniBand network. It is used for Oracle RAC cluster traffic and for databases to access data on the storage servers.
    *   **Connectivity:** Connects all database servers, storage servers, and control plane servers via RoCE switches within the rack.
    *   **Isolation:** This is a non-routable network fully contained within the rack.
    *   **IP Conflict Warning:** Because the control plane servers are connected to both the RoCE network and your corporate network, the IP ranges for the Admin and RoCE networks must **not conflict** with each other or with any hosts on your corporate network.

**Part 4: DNS, NTP, and Naming Requirements**

12. You must decide on the hostnames and IP addresses for the various network interfaces during deployment.

13. **DNS Requirement:** You must register the hostnames and IP addresses for the **client and backup network** interfaces in your corporate DNS.

14. **DNS and NTP Servers:**
    *   You must provide at least **one DNS server** and **one NTP server** that are accessible to the control plane servers and servers on the client network.
    *   You can provide up to **three** of each for redundancy.
    *   **NTP Purpose:** Ensures all system components are time-synchronized.
