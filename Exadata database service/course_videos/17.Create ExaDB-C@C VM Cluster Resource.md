**Part 1: Purpose of the VM Cluster**

1.  The **VM Cluster** creates the essential link between the Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure and the Oracle databases you deploy.
2.  The VM Cluster contains the installation of the **Oracle Database** and **Grid Infrastructure** software, which supports the databases running within the cluster.

**Part 2: Key Resources Defined in the VM Cluster**

3.  When defining the VM Cluster, you specify several critical resources:
    *   **Enabled CPU Cores (OCPUs):** This determines the amount of CPU resources available to your databases.
    *   **Memory Size per VM:** The amount of memory allocated to each virtual machine in the cluster.
    *   **Local Storage Size per VM:** The amount of local storage allocated to each VM.
    *   **Exadata Storage Size:** The total amount of shared Exadata storage allocated to the entire VM cluster.

**Part 3: Prerequisite for Database Creation**

4.  A **VM Cluster Network must be created and associated with a VM Cluster** before you can create any databases on your Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure.
