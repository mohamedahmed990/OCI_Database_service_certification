**Part 1: Initiating the Provisioning Process**

1.  To begin, open the navigation menu in the OCI web console.
2.  Select the desired **region** for deployment in the upper-right corner. Consider:
    *   Business requirements and technical performance needs.
    *   Proximity to your on-premise data center to minimize latency.
3.  Navigate to **Oracle Database** > **Exadata Cloud@Customer**. This opens the Exadata VM clusters page.
4.  On the left rail, click **Exadata Infrastructure**.
5.  On the Exadata Cloud Infrastructure page, click the **Create Exadata Infrastructure** button.

**Part 2: Basic Configuration**

6.  On the Create Exadata Cloud Infrastructure page, start by selecting the **compartment** where the resource will be located.
7.  Enter a **display name** for the infrastructure. This name does not need to be unique, as a unique Oracle Cloud Identifier (OCID) will be assigned automatically.
8.  Select the **Exadata system model** from the dropdown list. For most new configurations, select the latest available model.
9.  **Elastic Provisioning:** You can specify the desired number of compute and storage servers. The default values are 2 compute servers and 3 storage servers.
10. **Exadata Base Model:** This is an economical alternative to a quarter rack, coming in a single configuration with 2 database servers and 3 storage servers (but with less compute and storage capacity).

**Part 3: Network Configuration**

11. In the **Compute and Storage Configuration** section, enter the final number of desired compute servers and storage servers.
12. In the **Site Network Details** section, configure the **Cloud Control Plane Network**:
    *   Provide IP addresses for the two control plane servers.
    *   Provide the netmask and gateway IP.
    *   (If required) Enter your corporate HTTP proxy.
13. In the **Configure Exadata Systems Network** section, provide the IP address range for the internal admin and RoCE (private) networks using CIDR block notation.
    *   You can accept default values or specify custom values.
    *   **Admin Network CIDR Range:** Minimum /16, Maximum /23.
    *   **RoCE Network CIDR Range:** Minimum /19, Maximum /22.
    *   **Recommendation:** Allocating a smaller CIDR block prefix (e.g., /16, /19) reserves more IP addresses for future expansion.

**Part 4: DNS, NTP, and Time Zone**

14. You must register the hostnames and IP addresses for the client and backup network interfaces in your corporate DNS.
15. Provide the IP addresses for at least **one DNS server** and **one NTP server** accessible to the control plane and client network servers.
16. You can provide up to **three** DNS and NTP servers for redundancy. Use the "Add Another DNS Server" and "Add Another NTP Server" buttons.
17. NTP is used to synchronize the time across all system components.
18. Select the **time zone** for the infrastructure. The default is UTC.

**Part 5: Configuring Maintenance Preferences**

19. Click the **Edit Maintenance Preference** button to configure the automatic maintenance schedule.
20. **Maintenance Method:** Choose between **Rolling** (default, no outage) or **Non-Rolling** (full outage).
21. **Custom Actions:** Check the "Enable Custom Actions" button if you need to run custom scripts before Oracle performs maintenance on the DB servers.
22. **Maintenance Schedule:** You can choose **No Preference** or **Specify a Schedule**.
23. If you specify a schedule, configure the following:
    *   **Maintenance Months:** Specify at least one month per quarter. Specifying 2-3 months is recommended if you require a long notification lead time.
    *   **Week of the Month:** Specify the week (weeks start on the 1st, 8th, 15th, and 22nd). Maintenance cannot be scheduled for a "fifth week."
    *   **Day of the Week:** Specify a day. If unspecified, Oracle will choose a weekend day.
    *   **Start Hour:** Specify the hour. If unspecified, Oracle will choose a least disruptive time.
    *   **Lead Time:** Specify the number of weeks' advance notice you require for maintenance notifications.

**Part 6: Maintenance Contacts**

24. **Primary Contact:** You must add a primary contact **before activating** the infrastructure. This should be the contact associated with the CSI (Customer Support Identifier) for this infrastructure.
25. **Secondary Contacts:** You can add up to nine secondary contacts. Both primary and secondary contacts receive notifications about hardware, network, and software maintenance.
26. A secondary contact can be promoted to primary at any time.

**Part 7: Finalizing Creation**

27. Click **Create Exadata Infrastructure** to proceed.
28. If all inputs are valid, the **Infrastructure Details** page appears, outlining the next steps.
29. The infrastructure's state will be indicated by an orange icon with the initial status **"Requires Activation."**
