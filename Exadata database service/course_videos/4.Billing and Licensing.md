**Part 1: Licensing Models**

1.  The Exadata Database Service offers two cost-effective licensing models: License Included and Bring Your Own License (BYOL).

2.  The **License Included** model allows users to subscribe to Oracle Database software licenses as part of the service.

3.  This subscription includes:
    *   All features of Oracle Database Enterprise Edition.
    *   All Oracle Database Enterprise Manager Packs.
    *   All Enterprise Edition database options.

4.  The License Included model is ideal for:
    *   Customers without existing Oracle Database licenses.
    *   Customers seeking to use Oracle database features beyond their current licenses.

5.  The **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** model should be selected if your organization already owns the Oracle Database software licenses you wish to use.

6.  The BYOL model minimizes migration costs by maximizing the value of existing license investments.

7.  In the BYOL model, customers can deploy their existing Oracle Database Enterprise Edition and database option licenses.

8.  When bringing an Enterprise Edition license, customers are granted rights to use the following database options without needing separate on-premise entitlements:
    *   Transparent Data Encryption
    *   Data Safe
    *   Diagnostics Pack
    *   Tuning Pack
    *   Data Masking and Subsetting Pack
    *   Real Application Testing

9.  The Exadata storage server software is included in a BYOL subscription; customers do not need a separate license for it.

10. Oracle Standard Edition is **not** a supported version for use with the Exadata Database Service.

**Part 2: Vertical Scaling and Cost Efficiency**

11. Licensing costs are based on the number of OCPUs (cores) in use.

12. The ability to vertically scale VMs up and down based on workload is a major cost advantage of the cloud over on-premise deployments.

13. On-premise systems must be sized for peak workload, often leading to over-provisioning and paying for underutilized CPU cores.

14. Exadata Database Service allows you to scale OCPUs online with no disruption to the database service to match workload demand:
    *   Scale up for workload spikes.
    *   Scale down when demand drops.

**Part 3: Defense in Depth Security Strategy**

15. Defense in depth is Oracle's strategy to control IT systems by implementing controls throughout the stack to permit authorized work and prevent, detect, and respond to unauthorized work.

16. Security starts by securing the data within the **Oracle Database** using industry-leading features:
    *   Transparent Data Encryption (TDE) for data at rest.
    *   Data Redaction, Masking, and Subsetting to limit data visibility.
    *   Key Vault to separate control of TDE keys.
    *   Database Vault to control DBA access to user data.
    *   Database Firewall to control executable SQL statements.
    *   Data Safe to automatically detect sensitive data and assess risks.

17. **Compute resources** are secured with:
    *   Secure technical implementation guidelines for compliant deployments.
    *   Minimal software packages to reduce security risk.
    *   Token-based SSH access for secure login.

18. **Networking** is secured with:
    *   OCI Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs) for isolation.
    *   Oracle Native Network Encryption for client/database connections.
    *   Dedicated client and backup networks for traffic isolation.

19. The **Infrastructure** is subject to stringent compliance testing (e.g., FedRAMP, HIPAA, PCI) and is used by industries with high security demands.

20. The **OCI tenancy** provides additional security layers:
    *   Identity and Access Management (IAM).
    *   Support for federated identity providers.
    *   Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA).
    *   Policy-based access controls.
    *   Users, groups, and compartments for resource organization and isolation.
    *   Instance principals and resource principals.

21. This integrated, engineered systems approach provides control over how cloud services are created, accessed, used, maintained, and destroyed.

**Part 4: Special Focus - Operator Access Control**

22. **Operator Access Control** is a critical security feature that limits infrastructure access by Oracle operations staff.

23. It addresses the need for customers in regulated industries to retain control and visibility over their data, similar to an on-premise data center.

24. With Operator Access Control enabled:
    *   Oracle operations staff must request access to a customer's system.
    *   Customers can grant a designated operator access to a specific component for a specific time with specific privileges.
    *   Customers can observe and record the operator's commands and keystrokes in real-time.
    *   Customers can terminate an operator's session immediately if necessary.

25. This feature provides customers, especially in regulated industries, with the confidence to use the Exadata Database Service by ensuring full control over remote infrastructure access.
