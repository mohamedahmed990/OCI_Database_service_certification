**Part 1: Purpose and Prerequisite**

1.  Before creating a cluster on Exadata Cloud@Customer, you must first create an **Exadata VM Cluster Network**.
2.  The VM Cluster Network provides the essential link between the physical Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure and the VM clusters that will host your Oracle databases.

**Part 2: Function of the VM Cluster Network**

3.  You **must** create a VM Cluster Network and associate it with a VM Cluster **before** you can create a database on the infrastructure.
4.  The VM Cluster Network specifies and allocates network resources **from your corporate data center** to the Exadata system. These resources include:
    *   IP Addresses
    *   Hostnames
5.  Because the system is in your data center, the **client and backup subnets** are defined within the VM Cluster Network, **not** inside an OCI Virtual Cloud Network (VCN) in your cloud tenancy.

**Part 3: Outcome and Important Note**

6.  Once the VM Cluster Network is created and associated with a cluster, you can create and manage databases in the same way as you would with the Exadata Database Service in the public cloud.
7.  **Important Note:** A single Exadata Cloud@Customer infrastructure can support **multiple VM Cluster Networks**. However, each VM Cluster Network can be associated with only **one VM Cluster**.
