**Part 1: Overview of Scaling Flexible Exadata Systems (X8M and newer)**

1.  Starting with the X8M generation, Exadata systems feature a flexible model designed for easy in-place scaling, eliminating the need to physically migrate databases to a larger system.

2.  If an Exadata Cloud Infrastructure instance requires more resources, you can scale up the number of database servers or storage servers.

3.  The current number of provisioned servers can be viewed on the **Exadata Infrastructure Details** page in the **Exadata Resources** section.

4.  For X8M and newer multi-VM-enabled systems, scaling is done directly from the Oracle Cloud Console by selecting **Scale Infrastructure** on the Exadata Infrastructure Details page.

**Part 2: Utilizing Scaled-Up Resources**

5.  After adding database or storage servers to the Exadata infrastructure, you must add the increased capacity to the associated **Cloud VM cluster** to utilize the new CPU or storage resources.

**Part 3: Scaling Down Infrastructure**

6.  You can scale down an Exadata Cloud Infrastructure instance by selecting the desired lower number of database and storage servers.

7.  A database server can only be removed if there are no VMs running on it.

8.  A storage server can only be removed if it has not been used to expand the Exadata Infrastructure storage.

9.  The ability to remove database and storage servers is limited to deployments in the **public cloud**.

**Part 4: Scaling Older Fixed-Shape Systems (X6, X7, X8)**

10. Scaling older, fixed-shape Exadata Infrastructure resources (X6, X7, X8) requires relocating your database to a new, larger system shape.

**Part 5: Adding Storage Capacity to VM Clusters**

11. To make newly-added storage server capacity available to VM clusters, click the **Add Storage Capacity** button on the banner shown on the Exadata Infrastructure Details page.

12. You can add storage capacity from new servers to existing groups at any time.

13. The "Add Storage Capacity" process triggers a data rebalance across the existing VM clusters.

14. This step only makes the storage available for use by the VM clusters; it does not automatically allocate additional capacity to any specific VM cluster.

15. After the process completes, the total Exadata storage capacity displayed on the **Exadata Resources** section will increase (e.g., from 190 TB to 254 TB).
