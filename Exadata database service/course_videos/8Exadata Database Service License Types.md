**Part 1: How to Update the License Type**

1.  You can update the license type for a VM cluster **online** from the **Exadata VM Cluster Details** page.
2.  Click on the **Update License Type** action tab near the top of the page to make the change.

**Part 2: Available License Models**

3.  The Exadata Database Service offers two licensing models for the enabled OCPUs on a VM cluster: **License Included** and **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)**.

**Part 3: License Included Model**

4.  The **License Included** option allows users to subscribe to Oracle Database software licenses as part of the service.
5.  This subscription includes all the features of **Oracle Database Enterprise Edition**.
6.  This model is ideal for:
    *   Customers without existing Oracle Database licenses.
    *   Customers seeking to use Oracle Database features beyond what they are currently licensed for.

**Part 4: Bring Your Own License (BYOL) Model**

7.  The **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** option should be selected if your organization already owns the Oracle Database software licenses you want to use on the VM cluster.
8.  The BYOL model minimizes migration costs by maximizing the value of existing license investments.

**Part 5: Benefits and Inclusions of the BYOL Model**

9.  In the BYOL model, customers can deploy their existing **Oracle Database Enterprise Edition** and **database option** licenses.
10. When a customer brings an Enterprise Edition license to the service, they are granted rights to use the following database options **without needing separate on-premise entitlements**:
    *   Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
    *   Diagnostics Pack
    *   Tuning Pack
    *   Data Masking and Subsetting Pack
    *   Real Application Testing

11. The **Exadata system software** is included in a BYOL subscription. Customers do not need a separate license entitlement for it.
