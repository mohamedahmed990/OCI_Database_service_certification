### **1. Introduction to Exadata Database Service**
*   The Oracle Exadata Database Service leverages the power of the Oracle Exadata Database Machine with the efficiency of Oracle Cloud.
*   Each deployment is provisioned with a **complete Oracle Database installation** that includes:
    *   All Oracle Database Enterprise features.
    *   Entitlements to all Database Enterprise Management Packs.
    *   All Enterprise options (Oracle RAC, Oracle Database In-Memory, Oracle Multitenant).

### **2. Foundation: The Exadata Platform**
*   The foundation is the **Exadata Database Machine**, deployed globally at thousands of sites.
*   It is the **highest-performing and most available platform** for running Oracle Database.
*   Its **fault-tolerant architecture** features:
    *   Scale-out database servers.
    *   Scale-out intelligent storage servers.
    *   A fully redundant, high-performance **RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet)** network fabric.
*   It delivers advanced Exadata features like:
    *   SQL Offload
    *   Smart Flash Cache
    *   Storage Index
    *   Hybrid Columnar Compression

### **3. Cost & Management Model**
*   Customers pay a **monthly subscription fee** based on:
    *   The shape of the Exadata Cloud Infrastructure configuration.
    *   The number of enabled **OCPUs** (Oracle Cloud CPUs); 1 OCPU = 1 enabled database server CPU core.
*   **No initial capital cost** and no additional data center charges.
*   **Oracle manages** all supporting infrastructure:
    *   Data center networking
    *   Private Exadata RoCE networks
    *   Physical Exadata Database and storage servers
    *   Firmware and Exadata storage server software

### **4. Key Benefits and Differentiators**
*   **Easy Provisioning:** Web-based wizards for quick provisioning of systems and databases.
*   **Complete Service Isolation:** No overprovisioning of hardware ensures predictable response times and throughput.
*   **100% Compatibility:** Fully compatible with on-premise Oracle databases and all existing applications.
*   **Journey to the Cloud:**
    *   Enables on-premise Exadata customers to move to the cloud without compromising performance/availability.
    *   Allows traditional Oracle Database customers to easily start enjoying Exadata benefits.
*   **Most Complete Service:** Provides the ability to leverage:
    *   Oracle Cloud automation to simplify operational tasks.
    *   All Oracle Database and Exadata innovations.
*   **Consistency & Portability:** Feature consistency across deployment options allows for easy portability of databases from on-premise to cloud.

### **5. Included Features & Innovations**
*   **Oracle Database Key Features:** Multitenant, Oracle RAC, Active Data Guard, Partitioning, and others.
*   **Exadata Innovations:** XRMEM data accelerators, 100 Gbps RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) internal network fabric.
*   **License Included Model:** All these key capabilities and innovations are included when deployed with this model.

### **6. Co-Managed Service Model**
*   The Exadata Database Service is a **co-managed service**:
    *   **Oracle manages** the infrastructure.
    *   **You manage** the contents of the database VM using provided cloud automation tooling.
*   **Customer Control:**
    *   Customers have **root access** to the database VM for customization.
    *   It is **supported to install third-party agents**.
    *   Customers are in **full control of database VM patching**.
*   **Powerful Automation:** Provides a set of customer-controlled cloud automation to simplify operational and lifecycle tasks on their schedule.
*   **Cost:** Customers only pay for the compute resources they allocate and can scale them as needed.
*   **Ideal For:** Migrating any supported on-premise Oracle Database Enterprise version without changes.

### **7. Contrast with Autonomous Database**
*   **Autonomous Database** is a **fully managed** service with complete end-to-end automation.
    *   The database is self-managing; Oracle manages the infrastructure.
    *   **Eliminates** the cost of database and infrastructure management.
    *   Customers only pay for the compute resources used.
    *   **Auto-scaling** adjusts compute resources for varying workloads.
    *   **Automatic optimizations** improve performance for data warehousing, transaction processing, and JSON workloads.
*   **Focus of this module** remains on the **Exadata Database Service**.

### **8. Deployment Flexibility: The Greatest Differentiator**
The Exadata platform offers unparalleled deployment choice:

1.  **On-Premise (CapEx Model):**
    *   Own and manage the complete system.
    *   Total management flexibility.

2.  **Public Cloud (Exadata Cloud Infrastructure):**
    *   Oracle manages the infrastructure.
    *   Automation simplifies management tasks.
    *   **Pay-per-use subscription model** reduces costs.

3.  **Hybrid Cloud (Exadata Cloud@Customer):**
    *   Experience all cloud benefits while keeping data inside your own data center.
    *   Satisfies data residency and compliance requirements.

4.  **Multi-Cloud:**
    *   Can be connected to applications via **FastConnect**.
    *   Can be utilized natively in **Azure** with the **Oracle Database@Azure** offering.
*   **100% compatibility** across all deployments enables **zero downtime migration**.

### **9. Exadata Database Service on Dedicated Infrastructure (Public Cloud)**
*   Runs on **Exadata Cloud Infrastructure** in the Oracle public cloud.
*   **Ideal for** running enterprise-class Database-as-a-Service.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Power of Oracle Database + Performance of Exadata + Simplicity of Oracle Cloud.
    *   Infrastructure is **dedicated to you** but managed by Oracle.
    *   Choice of **License Included** or **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** models.
    *   **100% compatible** with existing applications.
*   **Management Division:**
    *   **Oracle manages:** Hardware, physical compute/storage servers, internal networking.
    *   **You manage:** Database virtual machines (VMs) and the database instances within them.
*   **Automation & Economics:**
    *   Powerful user-controlled automation for lifecycle operations (provisioning, updates, backups) via UI/APIs.
    *   **Elastic resource scaling:** License only the OCPUs your VMs use; scale up/down at will.
    *   **Pay only for resources used.**
    *   Short minimum term; virtually no financial commitment.

### **10. Exadata Database Service on Cloud@Customer**
*   Provides the **same** management model, cloud automation, APIs, and subscription-based economics as the public cloud service.
*   **Key Difference:** All data remains **in your own data center**.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Combine a cloud database service with existing on-premise applications without migration disruption.
    *   Data stays next to applications, satisfying **data residency and compliance requirements**.
*   **How it Works:**
    *   Databases are provisioned and subscribed to as a service.
    *   **Oracle manages** the Exadata Cloud@Customer Infrastructure.
    *   The **control plane** is deployed on a chosen public OCI region for best performance with other cloud services.
*   **Consistent Cloud Experience:**
    *   Same public cloud UI/API-driven provisioning and management.
    *   Same financial (pay-per-use) model.
    *   **Note:** Has a **four-year minimum subscription term** for the infrastructure element.
*   **Efficient Cloud Adoption Strategy:**
    *   Leverages existing data center investment.
    *   Keeps data next to applications.
    *   Maintains existing data security standards and data residency compliance.
