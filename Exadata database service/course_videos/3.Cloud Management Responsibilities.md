### **1. Cloud Management Responsibilities: The Shared Model**
*   The Exadata Database Service follows a simple cloud management model.
*   **Oracle's Responsibility (Manages infrastructure up to the hypervisor):**
    *   This includes the database servers, storage servers, the internal fabric network, and the hypervisor.
    *   Oracle performs infrastructure patching, security scans, and security updates.
    *   **Customers can schedule maintenance windows** for Oracle to perform infrastructure maintenance that aligns with their business needs.
    *   **Customers are not authorized to access the Oracle infrastructure.**
*   **Customer's Responsibility (Manages everything above the hypervisor):**
    *   The customer manages everything that runs in the database VM using cloud automation via the UI or REST APIs.
    *   This includes the guest VM, which contains:
        *   The database software.
        *   Grid Infrastructure.
        *   Customer data, schema, and encryption keys.
    *   The guest VM runs all supported Oracle Database versions (up to 23ai).
    *   Customers can install and manage additional software in the guest VM.
    *   Customers control who has access to the guest VM. **Oracle staff is not authorized to access the guest VM.**
    *   The customer owns everything inside the database, including data, schema, and encryption keys.

### **2. Benefits of Cloud Automation**
*   The service provides powerful **cloud automation tools** that give customers complete control over the components they need to manage.
*   **Cloud Automation UI and APIs** enable customers to manage VMs and databases.
*   **Cloud automation functions** enable customers to: create, delete, patch, backup, and scale resources up and down, along with other tasks.
*   **Database lifecycle management in the cloud** automates time-consuming tasks:
    *   Database provisioning.
    *   Resource scaling.
    *   Patching.
    *   Backup and recovery.
    *   High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) deployments with Data Guard.
*   **Benefits of Automation:**
    *   Helps IT teams avoid configuration and maintenance errors.
    *   Reduces the required database administration workload.
    *   Decreases the time required to deploy new database environments.
    *   Frees the DBA team to focus on delivering value-added functions.

### **3. Exadata Cloud Infrastructure Architecture (Public Cloud)**
*   The architecture consists of a collection of **database and storage servers** connected by an internal high-performance, secure **RoCE (RDMA over Converged Ethernet) network fabric**.
*   It uses a **scale-out architecture** where database services run cooperatively on both database and storage servers.
*   Database and storage servers can be **independently scaled horizontally** to meet business requirements.
*   **Database Virtual Machines (VMs):**
    *   Each physical database server hosts one or more database VMs.
    *   Each VM contains: Grid Infrastructure software, the database home software, and cloud automation tools.
    *   The VMs provide consistent high-performance and isolation between virtual database servers and the infrastructure.
*   **Networking:**
    *   Database VMs and storage servers communicate over the **secure RoCE internal network** for ultra high-speed compute-to-compute and compute-to-storage networking.
    *   **Client and backup networks** provide **50 Gbps connectivity** for high-bandwidth use cases (application connectivity, backup, data loading, Data Guard). These connect directly to your subnets in your Virtual Cloud Network (VCN).
*   **Management:**
    *   The **Oracle Cloud operations team** manages the infrastructure via a secure, isolated cloud management network.
    *   The **customer admin** manages the contents of the database VMs by connecting to the OCI control plane, using cloud automation functions via the console or APIs.

### **4. Rationale for Exadata Cloud@Customer**
*   **Why it's needed:** While public cloud works for many, some customers cannot move workloads to the public cloud due to:
    1.  **Regulations or Policies:** Data must remain under customer control in their data center.
    2.  **Application-Database Interdependencies:** Many-to-many relationships make it impossible to move only a few databases, as those left behind would experience unacceptable latency.
    3.  **Migration Difficulty:** It is too difficult to move everything at once.
    4.  **Comfort and Control:** Some companies are not ready for the public cloud and want to maintain control over their data.
*   **Solution:** Exadata Cloud@Customer allows you to "run the cloud in your data center," meeting you where you are in your cloud journey.

### **5. Exadata Cloud@Customer Architecture**
*   A full-featured Exadata system is deployed in the customer's local data center, similar to an on-premise deployment.
*   **Key Additional Components:**
    *   **Two local control plane servers** are added.
    *   These servers create a **secure tunnel** from the Exadata platform in the data center to the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) control plane in the public cloud.
*   **Function of the Tunnel:**
    *   Oracle sends **telemetry** to monitor system health.
    *   Oracle accepts **REST API calls** from OCI to manage the system.
*   **User and Management Access:**
    *   The **customer administrator** connects to the **OCI control plane** (via web UI or API) to monitor and manage the database VMs and instances running on the Exadata Cloud@Customer.
    *   **End users and applications** connect over the internal corporate network directly to the Exadata Cloud@Customer, as if it were any other on-premise database server.
*   **Management Division (Same as Public Cloud):**
    *   The **Oracle operations team (Cloud Ops)** manages the infrastructure (physical compute/storage servers, internal networking).
    *   Cloud Ops can access the infrastructure layer in your data center if issues require their attention.
    *   Oracle provides **customer and Oracle auditing and access controls** so the customer can be in full compliance and control of their data. (This will be discussed further in upcoming slides).
