**Part 1: Purpose of Reorganizing Compartments**

1.  You might need to reorganize which compartments hold Exadata Database Service resources to better control who can use and manage the service instances.

**Part 2: Overview of Compartments**

2.  In Oracle Cloud, **compartments** are used to organize cloud resources and control access to them.
3.  A compartment is a **logical group** (not a physical container) of related resources.
4.  Access is granted only to certain groups that have been given permission by an administrator.

**Part 3: Movable Resources and Dependencies**

5.  The following Exadata resources can be moved between compartments:
    *   Exadata Infrastructure
    *   VM Clusters
    *   Backup Destinations

6.  When you move a **VM Cluster** to a new compartment, its dependent resources move with it automatically.
7.  Dependent resources of a VM Cluster include:
    *   Database Homes
    *   Databases
    *   Automatic Backups of those databases

**Part 4: Steps to Move a Resource**

8.  Moving an Exadata Database Service resource is a simple, automated task completed in three steps:
    *   From the **Exadata VM Cluster Details** page, select **More Actions**.
    *   Click on **Move Resource**.
    *   On the **Move Resource** screen, choose the new destination compartment and click the **Move Resource** button to complete the task.

**Part 5: Important Notes for Moving Resources**

9.  To move resources, a user must have **sufficient permissions** on both the current compartment and the destination compartment.
10. If the resource being moved is in a **Security Zone**, the destination compartment must also be in a Security Zone.

**Part 6: Lesson Summary**

11. This lesson covered how to:
    *   Describe Exadata Database Service management roles and responsibilities.
    *   Describe and schedule Oracle-Managed Infrastructure Maintenance.
    *   Scale Exadata Cloud Infrastructure, VM Clusters, and VM cluster resources.
    *   Manage the VM Cluster.
