### **1. Introduction & Module Focus**
*   Hello. This is Tammy Bednar from Oracle.
*   Today, we will look at **Oracle Base Database Service on Virtual Machine DB Systems** in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI).
*   We will highlight features, covering:
    *   Fundamentals.
    *   Shapes and storage architecture of virtual machines.
    *   Availability aspects.
    *   Security insights.
*   **Module Focus:** The Oracle Base Database Service, which provides the ability to deploy full-featured Oracle databases in the cloud.

### **2. Service Overview & Key Features**
*   The service is available in **OCI regions around the world**.
*   It runs **Oracle Database Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition** workloads on flexible **virtual machine (VM) shapes**.
*   **Multilevel security** features include always-on database encryption and Oracle Data Safe.
*   **Licensing Options:**
    *   **License Included** option.
    *   **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** option.
*   **Supported Database Versions:** 19c, 21c, and 23ai.
*   Virtual machines running databases are referred to as **DB systems** in OCI.
*   You can run workloads on:
    *   **Single-instance** VM DB systems.
    *   **Two-node RAC** VM DB systems.
*   It is a **comanaged service**:
    *   **Oracle manages** the infrastructure.
    *   **You manage** the contents of the database VM using provided cloud automation functions via the UI console or APIs.

### **3. Benefits of Cloud Automation**
*   Provides a powerful set of **cloud automation functions and tools**.
*   Allows easy conduction of **database lifecycle operational tasks** on your schedule.
*   **Benefits:**
    *   Helps IT teams avoid configuration and maintenance errors.
    *   Reduces required database administration workload.
    *   Decreases time to deploy new environments.
*   **Automates time-consuming tasks:**
    *   Database provisioning.
    *   Resource scaling.
    *   Patching.
    *   Backup and recovery.
    *   HA and DR deployments with Data Guard.
*   Security is built in at all layers.
*   Frees DBAs to focus on value-added functions.

### **4. Licensing Models**
Two cost-effective licensing models are available:

**1. License Included Model:**
*   Includes all Oracle Database Enterprise Edition options plus Oracle Database Enterprise Manager packs.
*   A **subscription model** ideal for:
    *   Customers without sufficient existing licenses building new applications.
    *   Customers wanting to use Oracle Database features beyond their current licenses.
*   Cost efficiency and elastic OCPU metering drive innovation with features that may have been cost-prohibitive on-premises.

**2. Bring Your Own License (BYOL) Model:**
*   Minimizes cost when migrating existing workloads to the cloud.
*   Customers deploy their existing database and database option licenses.
*   **Key Benefit:** Bringing an Oracle Database Enterprise Edition license grants rights to use:
    *   Transparent Data Encryption (TDE).
    *   Diagnostics Pack.
    *   Tuning Pack.
    *   Data Masking and Subsetting Pack.
    *   Real Applications Testing.
    *   *...without needing separate licenses for these features.*
*   BYOL customers can save on support costs via the **Oracle Support Rewards program**, providing a **25% credit** of cloud spend to apply toward on-premises support bills.

### **5. License Included Tiers**
Four licensing tiers are available; each includes all options from lower tiers.

1.  **Standard Edition 2:**
    *   Multitenant (for up to 3 PDBs per CDB).
    *   Machine Learning.
    *   Spatial and Graph.

2.  **Enterprise Edition:**
    *   Adds Data Guard.
    *   Adds Enterprise Management Packs (Data Masking and Subsetting, Tuning and Diagnostics).

3.  **Enterprise Edition High Performance:**
    *   Adds Life Cycle and Cloud Management Packs.
    *   Adds Partitioning, Advanced Compression, and Advanced Security.
    *   *Required for Multitenant with more than 3 PDBs.*

4.  **Enterprise Edition Extreme Performance:**
    *   Includes all previous features.
    *   Adds Active Data Guard, RAC, and Database In-Memory.

**Important Notes:**
*   All tiers include **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**.
*   Licensing the Base Database Service **with RAC** or the Exadata Database Service with "License Included" **requires** the **Extreme Performance** tier.

### **6. Key Benefits & Architecture Details**
*   Enables building, scaling, and managing full-featured Oracle databases on VMs.
*   **Key benefits:**
    *   Ease of getting started.
    *   Durable, scalable storage.
    *   Ability to run RAC to improve availability.
*   You are the **only one with root access** to your database VM.
*   When launching a VM DB system:
    *   Select the Oracle Database version.
    *   A **single-container database (CDB)** is created in the VM.
    *   Choose the desired number of **OCPUs** and corresponding **memory size**.
*   **Billing:** OCPU usage is billed by the second based on the selected license tier.

### **7. Storage, Backups & Shapes**
*   Uses **OCI Block Volumes** attached to VMs for data storage.
*   **Backup Destination Choices:**
    *   Object Storage.
    *   **Recovery Service (default)** - offers more features at the same price as Object Storage.
*   **Shape Choices:** Ampere, AMD, and Intel **Flexible Shapes** with high-performance OCI Block Volume storage.
*   Maximum OCPUs, memory, and storage depend on the chosen **shape**.
    *   Memory amount is based on the number of OCPUs selected.
    *   The memory-to-OCPU ratio depends on the shape.

### **8. Scaling & Important Limitations**
*   **After creation,** you can **scale usable block-volume storage online**:
    *   Up to **80 TB for data**.
    *   Up to **20 TB for redo** logs.
    *   Available I/O performance increases as allocated storage scales up.
*   **Important Limitations:**
    *   Supports single-instance and two-node RAC deployments.
    *   **Cannot scale** an existing VM from a single-node to a two-node VM.
    *   Deploying a two-node RAC **requires** the **Extreme Performance Edition** license.
*   **Scaling in a RAC system:** OCPU scaling on a two-node RAC VM DB system is done in a **rolling manner** on one VM at a time.
