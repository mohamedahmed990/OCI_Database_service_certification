### **Part 1: Introduction & Service Overview**

1.  This module focuses on the **Oracle Base Database Service on Virtual Machine DB Systems**.
2.  The service provides the ability to deploy **full-featured Oracle databases** in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) regions worldwide.
3.  It runs **Oracle Database Enterprise Edition and Standard Edition** workloads on flexible **Virtual Machine (VM) shapes**.
4.  Key aspects we will cover include:
    *   Service fundamentals, shapes, and storage architecture.
    *   Availability features.
    *   Security insights.

### **Part 2: Key Features & Deployment Details**

5.  **Multilevel Security:** Includes features like always-on database encryption and integration with **Oracle Data Safe**.
6.  **Licensing Models:** Supports both **License Included** and **Bring Your Own License (BYOL)** options.
7.  **Supported Versions:** Oracle Database **19c, 21c, and 23ai**.
8.  **Deployment Types:** You can choose to run workloads on:
    *   **Single-Instance** VM DB systems.
    *   **Two-Node Real Application Clusters (RAC)** VM DB systems.
9.  **Service Model:** It is a **co-managed service**:
    *   **Oracle manages** the underlying infrastructure.
    *   **You manage** the contents of the database VM.
    *   You leverage powerful **cloud automation functions** via the UI console or APIs for life cycle management.

### **Part 3: Benefits of Cloud Automation**

10. The service provides automation tools that simplify database life cycle operational tasks, reducing errors and administrative workload.
11. **Automated tasks include:**
    *   Database provisioning.
    *   Resource scaling.
    *   Patching.
    *   Backup and recovery.
    *   High Availability (HA) and Disaster Recovery (DR) deployments with Data Guard.
12. This automation frees DBAs to focus on value-added business functions.

### **Part 4: Licensing Models & Tiers**

13. **Two Main Licensing Models:**
    *   **License Included:** A subscription that includes Oracle Database EE options and Enterprise Manager packs. Ideal for new applications or using features beyond current licenses. Promotes cost-efficient innovation.
    *   **Bring Your Own License (BYOL):** Minimizes cost when migrating existing workloads. Customers deploy their existing licenses.
        *   BYOL includes rights to use **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE), Diagnostics Pack, Tuning Pack, Data Masking and Subsetting Pack, and Real Application Testing** without additional licenses.
        *   Eligible for the **Oracle Support Rewards program**, providing a 25% cloud spend credit towards on-premises support bills.

14. **License Included Tiers (Four Tiers, cumulative features):**
    *   **Standard Edition 2:** Includes Multitenant (up to 3 PDBs), Machine Learning, Spatial and Graph.
    *   **Enterprise Edition:** Adds **Data Guard** and Enterprise Management Packs (Data Masking & Subsetting, Tuning, Diagnostics).
    *   **Enterprise Edition High Performance:** Adds Lifecycle & Cloud Management Packs, **Partitioning, Advanced Compression, Advanced Security**, and Multitenant for more than 3 PDBs.
    *   **Enterprise Edition Extreme Performance:** Adds **Active Data Guard, RAC, and Database In-Memory**.
    *   **Note:** All tiers include **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)**. RAC deployments (in Base Database Service) or Exadata Database Service require the **Extreme Performance** tier.

### **Part 5: Technical Architecture & Capabilities**

15. **Key Benefit:** You are the only one with **root access** to your database VM.
16. **Provisioning:** When launching a VM DB system, you select the Oracle Database version. A **single-container database** is created with that version.
17. **Compute & Billing:** You choose the number of **OCPUs** and corresponding memory. Billing is **per-second** based on the selected license tier.
18. **Storage:**
    *   Uses **OCI Block Volumes** attached to the VMs for data storage.
    *   **Backups:** Can be sent to **Object Storage** or the **Recovery Service** (default, offering more features at the same price).
19. **Shape Flexibility:** Choice of **Ampere, AMD, and Intel Flexible Shapes** with high-performance block storage to meet various requirements.
20. **Scaling & Limits:**
    *   Maximum OCPUs, memory, and storage depend on the chosen shape. Memory is based on the selected OCPUs and the shape's ratio.
    *   **Storage can be scaled online** up to **80 TB for data** and **20 TB for redo logs**.
    *   I/O performance increases as allocated storage is scaled up.
21. **Important Note on RAC:** You **cannot scale** a single-instance VM to a two-node RAC VM. Deploying a two-node RAC requires the **Extreme Performance Edition** license.
22. **RAC Scaling:** When scaling OCPUs on a two-node RAC system, the change is applied in a **rolling manner** (one node at a time) to maintain availability.
