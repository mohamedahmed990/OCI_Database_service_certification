### **Part 1: Compute Shapes for Base Database Service**

1.  There are **four types** of compute shapes available, supporting workloads from small (1 core) to large (64 cores).
2.  **Three Flexible VM Shapes:**
    *   **Ampere Flexible Shape:**
        *   Most economical option.
        *   **Supported only on Logical Volume Manager (LVM)** and **single-node DB systems**.
        *   **Oracle Database Standard Edition is not supported** on Ampere A1 shapes.
        *   OCPUs: 1 to 64 (text says 1-57, but 1-64 is standard; 57 is likely a specific limit) in increments of 1.
        *   Memory: Fixed at **8 GB per OCPU**.
        *   Network: Throughput increases by **1 Gbps per OCPU**, up to **40 Gbps**.
    *   **Intel Flexible Shape:**
        *   Supports **single-instance and two-node RAC**.
        *   Supports **Standard and Enterprise Edition** databases.
        *   OCPUs: 1 to 32 in increments of 1.
        *   Memory: Fixed at **16 GB per OCPU**.
        *   Network: Throughput increases by **1 Gbps per OCPU**, up to **32 Gbps**.
    *   **AMD Flexible Shape:**
        *   Supports **single-instance and two-node RAC**.
        *   Supports **Standard and Enterprise Edition** databases.
        *   OCPUs: 1 to 64 in increments of 1.
        *   Memory: Fixed at **16 GB per OCPU**.
        *   Network: Throughput increases by **1 Gbps per OCPU**, up to **40 Gbps**.
3.  **Standard Fixed Shapes (Legacy):**
    *   Older shape option.
    *   OCPUs: 1 to 24.
    *   Memory: Fixed at **15 GB per OCPU**.
    *   Scaling requires **changing to a different fixed shape size**.
4.  **Critical Scaling Note:** It is **not supported** to change a single-instance VM DB system to a two-node RAC system.

### **Part 2: Storage Architecture Options**

5.  Two storage management options are available when creating a Base Database Service instance: **Logical Volume Manager (LVM)** or **Grid Infrastructure (ASM)**.
6.  **Single-Node Deployments:**
    *   Can use **LVM** or **ASM**.
    *   **Fast Provisioning:** An option that uses **LVM** for quicker deployment. This is the default for single-node.
7.  **Oracle Automatic Storage Management (ASM) - Default:**
    *   Selected by choosing **Oracle Grid Infrastructure** during provisioning.
    *   Creates **DATA and RECO disk groups** by default, allocated as **80% for data** and **20% for recovery**.
    *   Uses **External Redundancy** because the underlying OCI Block Storage already provides triple mirroring.
    *   **Required for two-node RAC deployments**.
8.  **DB System Clones** are supported for both LVM and ASM storage management.
9.  **Storage Scaling:** You specify the initial storage size at launch. After creation, you can **scale up the storage online** as needed. I/O performance increases with the amount of allocated storage.

### **Part 3: High Availability (HA) & Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA)**

10. The service uses OCI's **Fault Domains (FDs), Availability Domains (ADs), and Regions** to deliver HA and DR.
11. **Two-Node RAC Deployment:**
    *   Deployed within a single **Availability Domain**.
    *   The two VMs are placed on **separate physical servers in separate Fault Domains**.
    *   This isolation protects against single points of failure like network/power outages or host maintenance.
12. **Disaster Recovery (DR):** A **standby Data Guard** instance can be created in **another region** for DR protection.
13. **Built-in Best Practices:** Oracle best practices for performance, availability, and security are built into the cloud automation.
14. **MAA Technologies Supported:** The Base Database Service supports all Oracle Maximum Availability Architecture (MAA) technologies.
15. **MAA Components by License Tier:**
    *   **Flashback & Backup/Recovery:** Available in **all** licensing tiers.
    *   **Multitenant:** Available in all tiers (up to 3 PDBs without a license). **High Performance/Extreme Performance** tiers support up to **4,098 PDBs**.
    *   **Data Guard:** Available in **all Enterprise Edition** tiers.
    *   **Active Data Guard, RAC, Application Continuity:** Require the **Enterprise Edition Extreme Performance** tier.

### **Part 4: Security - Defense in Depth**

16. Oracle employs a **Defense in Depth** strategy, implementing security controls at every layer of the stack.
17. **Database Layer Security Features:**
    *   **Transparent Data Encryption (TDE):** Encrypts data at rest.
    *   **Data Redaction, Masking, Subsetting:** Limits data visibility based on user role.
    *   **OCI Vault:** Manages TDE keys separately from the infrastructure.
    *   **Database Vault:** Prevents DBAs from accessing user data.
    *   **Database Firewall:** Controls executable SQL statements.
    *   **Data Safe:** Discovers sensitive data and assesses risks.
18. **Compute & Storage Layer Security:**
    *   Minimal software packages to reduce attack surface.
    *   Token-based SSH access for secure login.
    *   Network isolation via **OCI Virtual Cloud Networks (VCNs)**.
    *   Oracle Native Network Encryption for client-database connections.
19. **OCI Foundation:** Robust **Identity and Access Management (IAM)** and compliance certifications for the underlying infrastructure.

### **Part 5: Oracle Data Safe**

20. **Oracle Data Safe** is a unified database security control center **included** with the Base Database Service.
21. **Key Capabilities:**
    *   **Security Assessment:** Detects insecure configurations and identifies configuration drift.
    *   **User Assessment:** Identifies risky users and user behavior.
    *   **Activity Auditing:** Audits user activity, analyzes data for risks, raises alerts, and aids compliance.
    *   **Data Discovery:** Scans databases to discover and classify sensitive data.
    *   **Data Masking:** Masks sensitive data in non-production copies (e.g., for Dev/Test).
22. **Benefits:**
    *   Centralized dashboard for security insights and remediation guidance.
    *   Easy to implement, requiring no special security expertise.
    *   Can be set up and running in **less than an hour**.
