### **1. Module Overview**
*   In this module, we will cover:
    *   Management options for Oracle Cloud Databases.
    *   Prerequisites and permissions.
    *   Architecture for Oracle Cloud Databases.
    *   Enabling Database Management for Oracle Cloud Databases.
    *   Pricing.

### **2. Database Management Cloud Service Benefits**
*   You get a unified console for on-premise and cloud databases.
*   It provides lifecycle Database Management capabilities for:
    *   Monitoring
    *   Performance management
    *   Tuning
    *   Administration
*   You can use advanced database fleet diagnostics and tuning to troubleshoot issues and optimize performance.
*   You can optimize SQL with real-time monitoring and simplified database configurations.

### **3. Service Details & Management Options**
*   It's a managed cloud-native service, meaning it's managed and updated by Oracle and is routinely updated with new features.
*   It enables you to perform Database Management and performance diagnostics for individual databases or for a fleet altogether.
*   **Management Options for Oracle Cloud Databases:**
    *   **Basic Management:** Available at no additional cost.
    *   **Full Management:** An additional cost option that includes all Database Management features.
*   **Full Management Option Availability:**
    *   Available for Oracle Database Enterprise Edition and Oracle Database Standard Edition.
    *   **Note:** Performance Hub features are *not* available when using Oracle Database Standard Edition.
*   **Supported Versions:** Database Management supports Oracle Database version 11.2.0.4 and later.

### **4. Key Tasks You Can Perform**
*   Monitor the key performance and configuration metrics of your fleet of Oracle Databases.
*   Compare and analyze database metrics over a selected period of time.
*   Use Performance Hub for a single pane of glass view of database performance to quickly diagnose issues.
*   Use AWR Explorer to visualize historical performance data from AWR snapshots in easy-to-interpret charts.
*   Group your critical Oracle Databases (which reside across compartments) into a database group and monitor them.
*   Create and schedule SQL jobs to perform administrative operations on a single Oracle Database or database group.
*   Use ASH Analytics, SQL session, and Tuning Advisor capabilities to determine a database issue root cause and then fix it.

### **5. Prerequisites and Permissions: Step-by-Step**
To enable and use the service for Oracle Cloud Databases, you must complete these prerequisite tasks:

**Step 1: Set Database Monitoring User Credentials**
*   Set database monitoring user credentials (e.g., for user `DBSNMP`) in the Oracle Cloud Database.
*   The password must be Federal Information Processing Standards (FIPS) compliant.
*   Save the database user password as a secret in the OCI Vault service.
*   The Vault service is a managed service to centrally manage encryption keys and secret credentials.

**For Autonomous Databases:**
*   Click the **Enable** link for Database Management under **Associated Services** for the Autonomous Database.

**Steps 2 & 3: Create IAM Groups & Policies**
*   The tenancy administrator must create Identity and Access Management (IAM) groups for users who will enable and use data management.
*   It is recommended to create separate user groups for:
    *   Enabling Database Management.
    *   Using Database Management features.
*   Sample policies should be granted to a group (using "family" will grant all policies for that service/resource).
*   Required permissions include:
    *   Permissions for **Database Management**.
    *   **Database read** and **networking** permissions.
    *   Policies to manage passwords and connections with the **Vault services**.
    *   **Object storage** permissions.

### **6. Network Architecture: The Private Endpoint**
*   A **Database Management private endpoint** is required to enable communication between the service and the Oracle Cloud Database in a VCN.
*   The private endpoint is its network point of presence in the VCN.
*   You must add **ingress and egress security rules** to the network security groups (NSGs) or security lists in the database's VCN to allow this communication.
*   The private endpoint is a Virtual Network Interface Card (VNIC) with private IP addresses in a subnet of your choice.

**Important Notes on Architecture:**
*   For **external databases** (on-premises), a management agent (not shown) is required, along with OS/network checks, a dynamic group, and an agent install key.
*   **Endpoint Best Practices:** The private endpoint must be on a subnet that can communicate with the Oracle Cloud Database.
*   **Endpoint Limits:**
    *   **Single-Instance DBs (Bare Metal/VM):** Max of **5** private endpoints per region per tenancy.
    *   **RAC DBs:** Max of **1** private endpoint per region per tenancy.
    *   **Single-Instance Endpoint:** Has **one** private IP address.
    *   **RAC Endpoint:** Has **two** private IP addresses and can support up to **15** SCAN listeners.

### **7. Steps to Create a Private Endpoint**
Before creating a private endpoint, you must:
1.  Note the **VCN and subnet information** from the database system details page.
2.  Obtain the required **permissions** to work with virtual networking resources.
3.  Using security lists or NSGs, add **ingress and egress security rules** to enable communication.

### **8. Enabling the Service for Oracle Cloud Databases**
**For Database Cloud Service (Bare Metal, VM, Exadata):**
1.  From the service home page, navigate to **DB System > Database** and click the database name.
2.  On the Database Details page, click **Enable** for the label **Database Management**.
3.  Provide the required details.
4.  Choose between **Full Management** and **Basic Management**.
5.  Click the **Enable Database Management** button.

**For Exadata Cloud Service (ExaCS):**
1.  From the service home page, navigate to **Exadata VM Cluster > Database** and click the database name.
2.  On the Database Details page, click **Enable** for the label **Database Management**.
3.  Provide the required details.
4.  You will need to select:
    *   For Bare Metal/VM: The **Database system** in the chosen compartment.
    *   For ExaCS: The **VM cluster** in the chosen compartment (this provides the link between the Exadata resource and the database).
5.  Choose between **Full Management** and **Basic Management**.
6.  Click the **Enable Database Management** button.

### **9. After Successful Enablement**
*   Once enabled, you will see metrics on the metric page.
*   You can click the **Performance Hub** tab on the Database Details page to view real-time and historical performance data.
*   When **Full Management** is enabled, specific features (Fleet Summary, advanced Performance Hub, AWR Explorer, etc.) can be accessed by navigating to **Observability & Management > Database Management**.
*   **Reminder:** Full Management is available for Enterprise and Standard Edition, but Performance Hub features are *not* available for Standard Edition.

### **10. Pricing**
*   Here is an example of the pricing for the Database Management service.
*   **Note:** Pricing is subject to change at any time.
*   You should always check the official Oracle pricing site on oracle.com or consult with your Oracle Sales representative for the very latest information.
