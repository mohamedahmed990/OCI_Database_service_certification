Of course. Here is the transcript broken down into clear points, preserving every single word as requested.

**Part 1: Module Introduction**

1.  In this module, we will cover management options for Oracle Cloud Databases, prerequisites and permissions, architecture for Oracle Cloud Databases, enabling Database Management for Oracle Cloud Databases, and pricing.

**Part 2: Overview of Database Management Cloud Service**

2.  With Database Management Cloud Service, you get a unified console for on-premise and cloud databases with life cycle Database Management capabilities for monitoring, performance management, tuning, and administration.
3.  You can use advanced database fleet diagnostics and tuning to troubleshoot issues and optimize performance, optimized SQL with real-time monitoring, and simplified database configurations.
4.  Now let's dive into the details of the service, what it consists of, and how it functions.
5.  It's a managed cloud-native service, which means it's managed and updated by Oracle and is routinely updated with new features.
6.  While using the service, it enables you to perform Database Management and performance diagnostics for individual databases or altogether.

**Part 3: Management Options (Full and Basic)**

7.  Database Management features for Oracle Cloud databases are available as part of the full management and basic management options.
8.  Basic management option is available at no additional cost.
9.  Full management. This additional cost option includes all Database Management features.
10. The full management option is available for Oracle Database Enterprise Editions and the Oracle Database Standard Edition.
11. Performance Hub features are not available when using the Oracle Database Standard Edition.

**Part 4: Supported Versions and Key Features**

12. Database Management supports Oracle Database version 11.2.0.4 and later.
13. And you can use it to perform Database Management tasks, including monitor the key performance and configuration metrics of your fleet of Oracle Databases.
14. You can also compare and analyze database metrics over a selected period of time.
15. Use Performance Hub for a single pane of glass view of database performance, which enables you to quickly diagnose performance issues.
16. Use AWR Explorer to visualize historical performance data from AWR snapshots and easy-to-interpret charts.
17. Group your critical Oracle Databases which reside across compartments into a database group and monitor them.
18. Create and schedule SQL jobs to perform administrative operations on a single Oracle Database or database group.
19. Use ASH Analytics, SQL session, and Tuning Advisor capabilities to determine a database issue root cause and then fix it.

**Part 5: Prerequisites and Permissions**

20. Next, let's look at what prerequisites and permissions are needed to use the database management service.
21. To enable and use database management for Oracle Cloud Databases, you must review and complete the prerequisite tasks.
22. Step one, set database monitoring user credentials in the Oracle Cloud Database and save the database user password as a secret in the Vault service.
23. You must grant a database user, for example, DBSNMP, the privileges required to monitor and manage the Oracle Cloud Database.
24. The database user password checks and database management require the password to be Federal Information Processing Standards compliant.
25. After setting the monitoring user credentials, use the Oracle Cloud Infrastructure Vault service to save the database user password in a secret with an encryption key.
26. The Vault service is a managed service that enables you to centrally manage the encryption keys that protect your data and the secret credentials that you use to securely access resources.
27. To enable the database management service for an autonomous database, you click the Enable link for Database Management under associated services for the Autonomous Database.
28. Steps two and three. The tenancy administrator must create identity and access management groups with users who will enable and use data management.
29. It's recommended that you create separate user groups to perform the following tasks. One, enable Database Management. And two, use Database Management features.
30. Here are some sample policies as a reference. These should be granted to a group.
31. And using family will grant all of the policies for the family service or resource.
32. Permissions are needed for Database Management, database read, and networking.
33. Other policies are needed to manage the passwords and connections with the Vault services.
34. And object storage permissions are also required.

**Part 6: Networking and Private Endpoint**

35. A Database Management private endpoint is required to enable communication between Database Management and the Oracle Cloud Database in a VCN.
36. The Database Management private endpoint is its network point of presence in the VCN, in which the Oracle Cloud Database can be accessed.
37. You must add ingress and egress security rules to the network security groups or security lists in the Oracle Cloud Database's VCN to allow communication between the Database Management private endpoint and the Oracle Cloud Database.

**Part 7: Architecture Overview**

38. Now we will review the architecture for the Database Management service.
39. This diagram provides an overview of how a Database Management private endpoint communicates with the Oracle Cloud Database.
40. Private endpoint represents data management in the VCN on which the Oracle Cloud Database can be accessed as a Virtual Network Interface Card, or VNIC, with private IP addresses in a subnet of your choice.
41. Note that when using the Database Management service for an external database, a database on your premises, a management agent, not shown, would be further utilized.
42. And you would need to further verify OS and networking requirements for it, configure a dynamic group to let the management agent carry on communication with the OCI management agent service via resource principals, and create or copy an agent install key.
43. Review the other training modules or documentation if you need more details on the setup for external databases.

**Part 8: Private Endpoint Best Practices and Limits**

44. It is recommended that you follow endpoint best practices.
45. The private endpoint must be on a subnet in the customer VCN that can communicate with the Oracle Cloud Database.
46. You can create a maximum of five Database Management private endpoints in your tenancy per region to connect to single-instance Oracle Cloud Databases in the bare metal and virtual machine database systems.
47. You can create only one Database Management private endpoint in your tenancy per region to connect to RAC Oracle Cloud Databases.
48. The private endpoint for single-instance Oracle Cloud Databases has only one private IP address.
49. The private endpoint for Oracle Cloud Databases has two private IP addresses.
50. One private endpoint for RAC Oracle Cloud Databases can support up to 15 Single Client Access Network listeners, or SCANs.
51. This limit is not applicable to the number of RAC Oracle Cloud databases.

**Part 9: Steps Before Creating a Private Endpoint**

52. Before you create a Database Management private endpoint in the VCN, you must make a note of the VCN and subnet information which is available on the database system details page of the Oracle Cloud Database.
53. Next, obtain the permissions required to work with virtual networking resources in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure and create a Database Management private endpoint.
54. And lastly, using security lists or network security groups, you can add ingress and egress security rules to enable communication between the Database Management private endpoint and the Oracle Cloud Database.

**Part 10: Enabling Database Management for Different Services**

55. Now we will review what configuration to perform when enabling the Database Management service for the Oracle Cloud Databases.
56. In the Database Cloud Service from the bare metal, VM, and Exadata service home page, navigate to DB system database and click the database name.
57. On the Database Details page, click Enable for the label Database Management.
58. Provide the details required and choose between full management and basic management.
59. In ExaCS from the bare metal, VM, and Exadata service home page, navigate to Exadata VM cluster database and click the database name on which you want to enable Database Management.
60. On the Database Details page, click Enable for the label Database Management.
61. Provide the details required.
62. And along with that, choose between full management and basic management.

**Part 11: Configuration Details During Enablement**

63. Depending on the option selected, one of the following options is displayed.
64. Database system in the chosen compartment for bare metal and virtual machine DB systems, VM cluster in the chosen compartment for Exadata Cloud Service.
65. Select the cloud VM cluster that provides a link between the Exadata Cloud Infrastructure resource and the database.
66. In this case, we have chosen bare metal and virtual machine DB systems.
67. After providing the details required, we can now choose between full management and basic management and click the Enable Database Management button.
68. Once the enablement process successfully completes, you'll see the metrics on the metric page.

**Part 12: Accessing Features After Enablement**

69. On the Database Management services enabled, you can click the Performance Hub tab on the Database Details page to view real-time and historical performance data.
70. When full management is enabled, Database Management service-specific features, such as fleet summary, advanced Performance Hub features, AWR Explorer, et cetera, can be accessed by navigating to Observability and Management, then Database Management.
71. Remember that the full management option is available for Oracle Database Enterprise Editions and the Oracle Database Standard Edition and that Performance Hub features are not available when using the Oracle Database Standard Edition.

**Part 13: Pricing Note**

72. Here is an example of the pricing for the Database Management service.
73. Note that it is subject to change at any time.
