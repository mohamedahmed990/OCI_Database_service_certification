### **Introduction**
*   Welcome to the lesson on Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service, instant elasticity at table level.
*   In this session, we will discuss instant elasticity at table level.

### **Core Concept: Instant Elasticity**
*   We're fully elastic.
*   We have the ability to scale up or scale down.
*   So let's take a look at this in a little bit more detail.

### **Recap: Table Capacity**
*   We talked earlier about allocating throughput in storage capacity for our NoSQL table.
*   Scaling these capacities dynamically can provide a very cost-effective operation for running your application using the Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service.

### **Example: Weekly Workload Pattern**
*   Let's look at an example of where a NoSQL table is created for a website that has online activities during weekdays.
*   A good example of this might be a service that operates Monday through Friday.

#### **Workload Activity Description**
*   So on the first chart on the right, it shows you activities basically Monday through Friday.
*   And each one of those charts will be a different day. The first one on the left being Monday, the last one on the far right being Friday.
*   As you can see, the workload tends to increase from Monday through Wednesday, drops a little bit on Thursday, and again it increases on Friday.

#### **Daily Operations**
*   So assume the support services does queries and insert operation to the table.
*   In the queries and the new data inserts vary every day based upon the workload chart given in the slide.
*   For example, we see on Monday, the queries and insert are the same.
*   On Tuesday, we see insert operations are higher than queries.
*   Then the reverse is true for Wednesday.
*   And then Thursday and Friday have slightly different operational patterns.

### **Applying Elasticity to the Workload**
*   So based on the queries and the new data insert operations for each day, the right amount write and read throughput can be provisioned to meet the demand.
*   As you can see in the throughput chart, Wednesday and Friday require higher throughput to handle the higher levels of queries and inserts.

### **Business Benefits: Cost Efficiency**
*   As you can see in the last chart, the operating cost for each day is different based upon the throughput provisions according to the demands or requirements of the workload.
*   Businesses no longer need to purchase and maintain the infrastructure to support peak workloads, so this avoids over-provisioning the hardware and paying more than what the workload actually needs.
*   It no longer has to size hardware based upon the server capacity or the OCPU.
