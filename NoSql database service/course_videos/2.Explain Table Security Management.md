### **Introduction**
*   Welcome to Oracle University's lesson on Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service Security.
*   I'm your host, Sara.
*   Let's get started.

### **Session Overview**
*   In this session, we will cover Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service Security and discuss encryption as well as authentication and access control.
*   Let's dive in.

### **Core Security Features**
*   We offer both encryption and authentication control.

### **Authentication & Access Control with IAM**
*   Authentication is covered by Oracle's Identity and Access Management service, which lets you control what type of access a group of users has and to which specific resources they have access to.

#### **Governance Features: Compartments & Policies**
*   Oracle offers better and easier governance with capabilities, such as compartments.
*   A compartment is a logical isolation of resources for usage and billing.
*   Additionally, we offer policies with simple SQL-like syntax that are extremely easy to create, manage, and update.

### **Encryption**
*   We also offer encryption both at REST and in motion.

### **Conclusion**
*   This concludes our lesson on Oracle NoSQL Database Cloud Service Security.
*   Thanks for hanging with me.
*   I hope you learned something useful.
