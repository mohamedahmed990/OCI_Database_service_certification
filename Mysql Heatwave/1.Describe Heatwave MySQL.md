### **1. Introduction to MySQL HeatWave**
*   We'll start by going over MySQL HeatWave background.
*   We'll cover a features overview.
*   We'll discuss security and ease of use.

### **2. MySQL's Popularity and Usage**
*   MySQL is the number one open source database.
*   It is the second most popular database overall after the Oracle Database.
*   MySQL received the DBMS of the Year Award from db-engines.com.
*   According to a recent Stack Overflow survey, MySQL remains the number one choice for developers.
*   Its popularity is due to its ease of use, reliability, and performance.
*   MySQL is used by the world's most innovative companies (e.g., Twitter, Facebook, Netflix, Uber).
*   Its popularity extends across industries (finance, manufacturing, telecom, government) and to students and small companies.
*   MySQL became very popular as part of the LAMP stack (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP/Perl/Python) for web and e-commerce applications.
*   Finance companies use MySQL for digital payment processing and fraud detection.
*   Manufacturing companies use MySQL for IoT platforms to monitor and control appliances and devices.
*   Users say: "We love it. It just works."

### **3. Challenges with Traditional MySQL and Other Cloud Offerings**
*   MySQL is optimized for OLTP (Online Transaction Processing) but not for analytic processing.
*   Customers must run two separate databases for transaction processing and analytics.
*   This requires a complex and time-consuming ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) process to move data.
*   Data in the separate analytics database becomes stale, preventing real-time analytics.
*   Security and compliance risks increase as data moves between data stores.
*   Costs increase due to using two different databases plus the ETL process.

### **4. MySQL HeatWave: The Unified Solution**
*   MySQL HeatWave provides a single unified platform for transactional and analytics workloads.
*   HeatWave is a massively parallel, high-performance, in-memory query accelerator.
*   It increases MySQL performance by orders of magnitude for analytics and mixed workloads.
*   Customers run analytics on data stored in MySQL without the need for ETL.
*   It eliminates the need for a separate analytics database.
*   It is faster than comparable database services at a fraction of the cost.
*   Changes from MySQL transactions are replicated in real-time to the HeatWave cluster.
*   This enables real-time analytics as data becomes immediately available for queries.
*   The risk of data compromise is eliminated since data isn't transferred between databases.
*   HeatWave is designed as a MySQL pluggable storage engine, shielding implementation details from customers.
*   Existing MySQL and Amazon Aurora-based applications work without any modification.
*   They access HeatWave through MySQL using standard connectors.

### **5. MySQL HeatWave Lakehouse**
*   Organizations face a data deluge that is challenging to manage.
*   Databases are not well-suited for all data types (e.g., from devices, social media, IoT sensors).
*   Data is voluminous, changes rapidly, and is costly to load into a database.
*   Over 80% of data is in files and massively growing.
*   99.5% of collected data remains unused due to lack of time, resources, and expertise.
*   MySQL HeatWave Lakehouse enables querying half a petabyte of data in multiple formats (CSV, Parquet, Aurora, Redshift export files) in object store.
*   Customers can leverage HeatWave benefits even when data is not in a MySQL database.
*   Customers can query transactional data in MySQL, data in object storage, or a combination using standard SQL.
*   Customers can query up to 500 terabytes of data.
*   The HeatWave cluster scales to 512 nodes.
*   Querying data in the object store is as fast as querying the database (an industry first).
*   Data is processed and transformed into HeatWave's in-memory optimized hybrid columnar format in the object store, not copied to the MySQL database.
*   This allows customers to use HeatWave for non-MySQL workloads.
*   MySQL HeatWave Lakehouse provides one service for transactions, analytics across data warehouses/lakes, and machine learning without ETL.

### **6. HeatWave AutoML (Machine Learning)**
*   MySQL users lack an easy way to build machine learning models using their database data.
*   Developers and data scientists typically need to move data (via ETL) to separate ML products/services.
*   This causes delays, increases costs, and raises security risks.
*   It also requires learning new tools and languages.
*   HeatWave AutoML includes everything to build, train, deploy, and explain machine learning models at no additional cost.
*   No separate machine learning service is needed.
*   It provides native, in-database machine learning for data stored inside MySQL HeatWave.
*   Benefits: Accelerate ML initiatives, increase security, reduce costs.
*   It automates the ML lifecycle (algorithm selection, data sampling, feature selection, hyperparameter optimization).
*   Aspects of the pipeline can be customized.
*   All models trained are explainable, aiding regulatory compliance, fairness, and trust.
*   Users build models using familiar SQL commandsâ€”no need to learn new tools.
*   It is integrated with popular notebooks (Jupyter, Apache Zeppelin).

### **7. MySQL AutoPilot**
*   MySQL AutoPilot automates key aspects of achieving high query performance at scale.
*   It uses advanced machine learning to automate HeatWave, improving performance and ease of use.
*   Key capabilities include:
    *   **Auto Provisioning:** Predicts the number of HeatWave nodes required.
    *   **Auto Shape Prediction:** Recommends the right compute shape for best price performance.
    *   **Auto Data Placement:** Predicts optimal columns to partition data in memory.
    *   **Auto Query Plan Improvement:** Learns from query execution to boost performance.
    *   **Auto Thread Pooling:** Allows processing more transactions for higher OLTP throughput.
    *   **Auto Error Recovery:** Self-explanatory fault recovery.
*   No other MySQL Database Service provides these capabilities.

### **8. Security and Ease of Use**
*   MySQL DBAs are often overloaded with mundane tasks.
*   MySQL HeatWave on OCI automates time-consuming tasks, improving productivity.
*   Developers get the latest features directly from the MySQL team.
*   Other clouds use outdated or forked versions of MySQL.
*   Developers can use the MySQL Document Store to mix SQL and NoSQL.
*   MySQL HeatWave is built on Gen 2 Cloud Infrastructure.
*   Data is encrypted for privacy on OCI block volumes.

### **9. Gen 2 Cloud Infrastructure**
*   Oracle Cloud is secure by design and architected differently from competitors' Gen 1 clouds.
*   Gen 2 provides maximum isolation and protection.
    *   Oracle cannot see customer data.
    *   Users cannot access Oracle's cloud control computers.
*   Gen 2 architecture offers superior performance on compute objects.
*   Oracle Cloud is open; customers can run Oracle, third-party, or open-source software without lock-in.

### **10. Advanced Security Features**
